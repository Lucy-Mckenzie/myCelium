# MyCelium Project
v 0.1.0
##
MyCelium is a simple mushroom growing game where you can grow mushrooms and harvest them to sell on the mushroom market. Grow up to 3 different mushroom types (eventually...) to sell and rake in the profits! What do you do with these profits? Many crimes are available >:3

# Design Brief:

The idea for MyCelium came from another student in our group project. She proposed creating a game where players could grow mushrooms and sell them for profit.
Myself and six others jumped on this idea, and together we spent a week learning how to incorporate Phaser.js into React.<br><br>
The idea is simple: you plant spores on a tile, watch the mushroom grow through three stages, water and fertilize it, then harvest the mushroom and sell it at the market to buy more spores.

# AGILE FACILITOR

Myself and one other person were the Agile facilitators. Our task was to create systems and processes to ensure that everyone had work to do, no one encountered obstacles, and the workflow remained smooth.<br><br>
We held daily standups 3-4 times a day, where we asked three fundamental questions: "What have you been working on?", "Have you run into any blocks?", "And what are you working on next?". Managing a team of six, this approach was the most effective way to ensure that everyone was heard and supported.

# Tech Stack and Explaination
For this project, we used Phaser.js for the game, Howl for the audio, and React with TypeScript for the frontend framework.
Phaser.js and Howl were new libraries to all of us, which introduced a steep learning curve during the planning stage of the project.<br><br>
     
# Problems and Thought processes 
As I mentioned above, we used Phaser.js for the game logic, which was a significant challenge. Adding TypeScript and React on top only made things more complicated.
I had an incredible team that managed the Phaser logic, which allowed me and a few others to focus on UI/UX design. In this part, we created interactive elements and connected them seamlessly to the game.<br><br>
Working in a team of six was complex but very satisfying. As the Agile facilitator, I found the entire process to be an incredibly rewarding experience.
